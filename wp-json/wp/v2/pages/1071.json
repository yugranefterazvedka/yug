A type of fossil fuel, crude oil can be refined to produce usable products such as gasoline, diesel and various forms of petrochemicals. It is a nonrenewable resource, which means that it can&#8217;t be replaced naturally<br \/>\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Crude oil is typically obtained through drilling, where it is usually found alongside other resources, such as natural gas (which is lighter, and therefore sits above the crude oil) and saline water (which is denser, and sinks below). It is then refined and processed into a variety of forms, such as gasoline, kerosene and asphalt, and sold to consumers.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Although it is often called &#8220;black gold,&#8221; crude oil has ranging viscosity and can vary in color from black and yellow depending on its hydrocarbon composition. Distillation, the process by which oil is heated and separated in different components, is the the first stage in refining.<\/span><\/p><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a6dde25 elementor-align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-button\" data-id=\"a6dde25\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"button.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-button-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-button elementor-button-link elementor-size-sm\" href=\"https:\/\/grandpetrokaz.kz\/contact\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-button-content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-button-text\">Get A Free Quote<\/span>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-c17b61a elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"c17b61a\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-33 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-bda029b\" data-id=\"bda029b\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-33 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-a017f68\" data-id=\"a017f68\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4ba5eec elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4ba5eec\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9r c1-1k c1-1e c1-9s\">The Different Types of Oil<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9r c1-1k c1-1e c1-9s\">West Texas Intermediate (WTI)<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">This type of oil contains low amounts of sulfur and density.

Th?is measurement reflects how light or heavy a crude oil is compared to water. If an oil\u2019s API Gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter than water and will float on it. If an oil\u2019s API Gravity is less than 10, it is heavier than water and will sink.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Lighter crude is easier and less expensive to produce.

For example, the U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), has a relatively high natural yield of desirable end-products, including gasoline. But the process also yields about one third \u201cresiduum,\u201d a residual by-product that must be reprocessed or sold at a discount. In contrast, simple distillation of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Arabian Light, the historical benchmark crude, yields almost half &#8220;residuum.&#8221; This difference gives WTI a higher premium.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">The lighter the oil, the more of the desirable, in-demand products it produces through distillation at a range of temperatures. At the lowest distillation temperatures, products produced include liquid petroleum gases (LPG), naphtha and so-called &#8220;straight run&#8221; gasoline. In the middle range of distillation temperatures, the refinery produces jet fuel, home heating oil, and diesel fuel.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">At the highest distillation temperatures &#8212; over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 the heaviest products are produced, including residuum or residual fuel oil, which can be used for lubricants. To maximize output of more desirable products, refineries commonly reprocess the heaviest products into lighter products.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9r c1-1k c1-1e c1-9s\">Are Some Crude Oils More Toxic Than Others?<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u201cToxicity\u201d refers to how harmful an oil might be to humans and other living organisms, as well as to land and water. Generally, the lighter the oil, the more toxic it is considered.\u00a0Because of the constant potential of spills, the Environmental Protection Agency has classified crude oil in four categories that reflect how the oil would behave in spills and its aftermath:<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9r c1-1k c1-1e c1-9s\">Class A:\u00a0<\/strong>Because they are light and highly liquid, these clear and volatile oils can spread quickly on impervious surfaces and on water. Their odor is strong, and they evaporate quickly, emitting volatiles. Usually flammable, these oils also penetrate porous surfaces, such as dirt and sand, and may remain in areas into which they seep. Humans, fish, and other plant and animal life face the danger of toxicity to Class A oils.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9r c1-1k c1-1e c1-9s\">Class B:\u00a0<\/strong>Considered less toxic than Class A, these oils are generally non-sticky but feel waxy or oily. The warmer they get, the more likely Class B oils\u00a0soak into surfaces; they can be hard to remove. When volatile components of Class B oils evaporate, the result can be a Class C or D residue. Class B includes medium to heavy oils.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9r c1-1k c1-1e c1-9s\">Class C:\u00a0<\/strong>These heavy, tarry oils, which include residual fuel oils and medium to heavy crudes, are slow to seep into porous solids and are not highly toxic. However, Class C oils are difficult to flush away and can sink in water and can smother or drown wildlife.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9r c1-1k c1-1e c1-9s\">Class D:<\/strong>\u00a0Non-fluid, thick oils are comparatively non-toxic and don\u2019t seep into porous surfaces. Mostly black or dark brown, Class D oils tend to dissolve and cover surfaces when they get hot, which makes them hard to clean up. Heavy crude oils, such as the bitumen found in tar sands, fall into this class.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9r c1-1k c1-1e c1-9s\">What drives Trading in Crude Prices Futures and Options<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Rising energy sector volatility ensures strong trends that can produce consistent returns for short-term swing trades and long-term timing strategies making crude oil trading offers excellent opportunities to profit in nearly all market conditions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Crude oil moves through perceptions of supply and demand, affected by worldwide output, as well as global economic prosperity. Professional traders and hedgers dominate the energy futures markets, with industry players taking positions to offset physical exposure while hedge funds speculate on long- and short-term direction. Retail traders and investors exert less influence here.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Retail\u2019s influence rises when crude oil trends sharply, attracting capital from small players who are drawn into these markets by front-page headlines.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Crude oil trades through two primary markets, Western Intermediate and Brent. WTI originates in the U.S. Permian Basin and other local sources while Brent comes from more than a dozen fields in the North Atlantic. These varieties contain different sulfur content and API gravity, with lower WTI levels commonly called light sweet crude oil. \u00a0Brent has become a better indicator of worldwide pricing in recent years, although WTI in 2017 was more heavily traded in the world futures markets<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Pricing between these grades stayed within a narrow band for years, but that came to an end in 2010 when the two markets diverged sharply due to a rapidly changing supply versus demand environment. The rise of U.S. oil production, driven by shale and fracking technology, increased WTI output at the same time Brent drilling underwent a rapid decrease.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">U.S. law dating back to the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s has aggravated this division, prohibiting local oil companies from selling their inventory in overseas markets. Those laws are likely to change in coming years, perhaps narrowing the spread between WTI and Brent, but other supply factors could intervene and keep the divergence in place.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">WTI crude oil rose after World War II, peaking in the upper $20s and entering a narrow band until the embargo in the 1970s triggered a parabolic rally to $120. It peaked late in the decade and began a tortuous decline, dropping into the teens ahead of the new millennium. Crude oil entered a new and powerful uptrend in 1999, rising to an all-time high at $157.73 in June 2008. It then dropped into a massive trading range between that level and the upper $20s, settling around $55 at the end of 2017.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">The NYMEX WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil futures contract (CL) trades in excess of 10 million contracts per month, offering superb liquidity. However, it has a relatively high risk due to the 1,000 barrel contract unit and .01 per barrel minimum price fluctuation. There are dozens of other energy-based products offered through NYMEX, with the vast majority attracting professional speculators but few private traders or investors.<\/span><\/p><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-33 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-274bcb3\" data-id=\"274bcb3\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crude Oil What is Crude Oil and what are the available types Crude oil is a naturally occurring, unrefined petroleum product composed of hydrocarbon deposits and other organic materials.
