distillation, either as a distillate or a residue. In general terms, fuel oil is any liquid fuel that is burned in a furnace or boiler for the generation of heat or used in an engine for the generation of power, except oils having a flash point of approximately 42 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F) and oils burned in cotton or wool-wick burners. Fuel oil is made of long hydrocarbon chains, particularly alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatics. The term\u00a0<em class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-3j c1-9y c1-9z\">fuel oil<\/em>\u00a0is also used in a stricter sense to refer only to the heaviest commercial fuel that can be obtained from crude oil, i.e., heavier than gasoline and naphtha.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Small molecules like those in propane, naphtha, gasoline for cars, and jet fuel have relatively low boiling points, and they are removed at the start of the fractional distillation process. Heavier petroleum products like Diesel and lubricating oil are much less volatile and distill out more slowly, while bunker oil is literally the bottom of the barrel; in oil distilling, the only things denser than bunker fuel are carbon black feedstock and bituminous residue (asphalt), which is used for paving roads and sealing roofs.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">In Europe, the use of diesel is generally restricted to cars (about 40%), SUVs (about 90%), and trucks and buses (over 99%). The market for home heating using fuel oil, called heating oil, has decreased due to the widespread penetration of natural gas as well as heat pumps. However, it is very common in some areas, such as the Northeastern United States.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Residual fuel oil is less useful because it is so viscous that it has to be heated with a special heating system before use and it may contain relatively high amounts of pollutants, particularly sulfur, which forms sulfur dioxide upon combustion. However, its undesirable properties make it very cheap. In fact, it is the cheapest liquid fuel available. Since it requires heating before use, residual fuel oil cannot be used in road vehicles, boats or small ships, as the heating equipment takes up valuable space and makes the vehicle heavier. Heating the oil is also a delicate procedure, which is impractical on small, fast moving vehicles. However, power plants and large ships are able to use residual fuel oil.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Use of residual fuel oil was more common in the past. It powered boilers, railroadsteam locomotives, and steamships. Locomotives, however, have become powered by diesel or electric power; steamships are not as common as they were previously due to their higher operating costs (most LNG carriers use steam plants, as &#8220;boil-off&#8221; gas emitted from the cargo can be used as a fuel source); and most boilers now use heating oil or natural gas. Some industrial boilers still use it and so do some old buildings, including in New York City. In 2011 The City estimated that the 1% of its buildings that burned fuel oils No. 4 and No. 6 were responsible for 86% of the soot pollution generated by all buildings in the city. New York made the phase out of these fuel grades part of its environmental plan, PlaNYC, because of concerns for the health effects caused by fine particulates, and all buildings using fuel oil No. 6 had been converted to less polluting fuel by the end of 2015.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Residual fuel&#8217;s use in electrical generation has also decreased. In 1973, residual fuel oil produced 16.8% of the electricity in the US. By 1983, it had fallen to 6.2%, and as of 2005, electricity production from all forms of petroleum, including diesel and residual fuel, is only 3% of total production. The decline is the result of price competition with natural gas and environmental restrictions on emissions. For power plants, the costs of heating the oil, extra pollution control and additional maintenance required after burning it often outweigh the low cost of the fuel. Burning fuel oil, particularly residual fuel oil, produces uniformly higher carbon dioxide emissions than natural gas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Heavy fuel oils continue to be used in the boiler &#8220;lighting up&#8221; facility in many coal-fired power plants. This use is approximately analogous to using kindling to start a fire. Without performing this act it is difficult to begin the large-scale combustion process.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">The chief drawback to residual fuel oil is its high initial viscosity, particularly in the case of No. 6 oil, which requires a correctly engineered system for storage, pumping, and burning. Though it is still usually lighter than water (with a specific gravity usually ranging from 0.95 to 1.03) it is much heavier and more viscous than No. 2 oil, kerosene, or gasoline. No. 6 oil must, in fact, be stored at around 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) heated to 65\u2013120 \u00b0C (149\u2013248 \u00b0F) before it can be easily pumped, and in cooler temperatures it can congeal into a tarry semisolid. The flash point of most blends of No. 6 oil is, incidentally, about 65 \u00b0C (149 \u00b0F). Attempting to pump high-viscosity oil at low temperatures was a frequent cause of damage to fuel lines, furnaces, and related equipment which were often designed for lighter fuels.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">For comparison, BS 2869 Class G heavy fuel oil behaves in similar fashion, requiring storage at 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), pumping at around 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F) and finalizing for burning at around 90\u2013120 \u00b0C (194\u2013248 \u00b0F).<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Most of the facilities which historically burned No. 6 or other residual oils were industrial plants and similar facilities constructed in the early or mid 20th century, or which had switched from coal to oil fuel during the same time period. In either case, residual oil was seen as a good prospect because it was cheap and readily available. Most of these facilities have subsequently been closed and demolished, or have replaced their fuel supplies with a simpler one such as gas or No. 2 oil. The high sulfur content of No. 6 oil\u2014up to 3% by weight in some extreme cases\u2014had a corrosive effect on many heating systems (which were usually designed without adequate corrosion protection in mind), shortening their lifespans and increasing the polluting effects. This was particularly the case in furnaces that were regularly shut down and allowed to go cold, since the internal condensation produced sulfuric acid.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Environmental cleanups at such facilities are frequently complicated by the use of asbestos insulation on the fuel feed lines. No. 6 oil is very persistent, and does not degrade rapidly. Its viscosity and stickiness also make remediation of underground contamination very difficult, since these properties reduce the effectiveness of methods such as air stripping.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">When released into water, such as a river or ocean, residual oil tends to break up into patches or tarballs\u2014mixtures of oil and particulate matter such as silt and floating organic matter- rather than form a single slick. An average of about 5-10% of the material will evaporate within hours of the release, primarily the lighter hydrocarbon fractions. The remainder will then often sink to the bottom of the water column.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">General Classification<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">United States<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Although the following trends generally hold true, different organizations may have different numerical specifications for the six fuel grades. The boiling point and carbon chain length of the fuel increases with fuel oil number. Viscosity also increases with number, and the heaviest oil must be heated for it to flow. Price usually decreases as the fuel number increases.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">Number 1 fuel oil<\/strong>\u00a0is a volatile distillate oil intended for vaporizing pot-type burners.

Heating &amp; Draining:<\/strong>\u00a0The fuel delivered to the ship is stored in the bunker tank where it is heated by supplying steam to the coils installed in the bunker tanks. Heating is an essential process, which makes it an integral part of fuel oil treatment. The average temperature maintained for heavy fuel oil bunker tanks is around 40\u00baC. After transferring it to a settling tank, the fuel is further heated to ensure it is at an appropriate temperature to enter the separators. Once the fuel is transferred to the service tank from the separator, the oil temperature is &gt;80\u00baC. The main intention is to ensure the smooth pumpability of the fuel oil at different processes and to separate the maximum quantity of water from fuel by draining the settling and service tanks and using purifiers.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">2. Purifiers:<\/strong>\u00a0For removal of water and sludge from the heavy grade oil, fuel oil purifiers are used. Depending upon the owner\u2019s choice, either conventional or modern purifiers (computer driven fuel cleaning systems) can be installed on a ship. The oil flow remains continuous even during the sludge discharge process. Purification of heavy fuel oil is considered to be the most critical treatment process and is carried out on all commercial ships.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">3. Filtration:<\/strong>\u00a0Heating and purification process is used to separate water from the fuel. However, the solid impurities such as fine metal particles which can cause abrasion wear in the fuel system must also be removed. A fine filter is placed in the fuel oil supply line, which blocks the fine metal particles. These are full-flow units and the substance used inside the filters is usually natural, or synthetic fibrous woollen felt material.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">4. Chemical treatment:<\/strong>\u00a0Just like the automotive industry where fuel additives are popular, the maritime industry also uses chemicals in fuels for different jobs; However, this process is not much popular. The main types of residual fuel additives for marine heavy fuel oil are:<br \/>\u2022 pre-combustion additives such as demulsifiers, dispersants<br \/>\u2022 combustion improvers<br \/>\u2022 ash modifiers<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Class C1 and C2 fuels are kerosene-type fuels. C1 is for use in flueless appliances (e.g. lamps). C2 is for vaporising or atomising burners in appliances connected to flues.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Class A2 fuel is suitable for mobile, off-road applications that are required to use a sulphur-free fuel. Class D fuel is similar to Class A2 and is suitable for use in stationary applications, such as domestic, commercial, and industrial heating. The BS 2869 standard permits Class A2 and Class D fuel to contain up to 7% (V\/V) biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester, FAME), provided the FAME content meets the requirements of the BS EN 14214 standard.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Classes E to H are residual oils for atomizing burners serving boilers or, with the exception of Class H, certain types of larger combustion engines. Classes F to H invariably require heating prior to use; Class E fuel may require preheating, depending on ambient conditions.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">Russia<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Mazut is a residual fuel oil often derived from Russian petroleum sources and is either blended with lighter petroleum fractions or burned directly in specialized boilers and furnaces. It is also used as a petrochemical feedstock. In the Russian practice, though, &#8220;mazut&#8221; is an umbrella term roughly synonymous with the fuel oil in general, that covers most of the types mentioned above, except US grades 1 and 2\/3, for which separate terms exist (kerosene and diesel fuel\/solar oil respectively \u2014 Russian practice doesn&#8217;t differentiate between diesel fuel and heating oil). This is further separated in two grades, &#8220;naval mazut&#8221; being analogous to US grades 4 and 5, and &#8220;furnace mazut&#8221;, a heaviest residual fraction of the crude, almost exactly corresponding to US Number 6 fuel oil and further graded by viscosity and sulphur content.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">Maritime fuel classification<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">In the maritime field another type of classification is used for fuel oils:<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">MGO (Marine gas oil)<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; roughly equivalent to No. 2 fuel oil, made from distillate only<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">MDO (Marine diesel oil)<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; A blend of heavy gasoil that may contain very small amounts of black refinery feed stocks, but has a low viscosity up to 12 cSt so it need not be heated for use in internal combustion engines<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">IFO (Intermediate fuel oil)<\/strong>\u00a0A blend of gasoil and heavy fuel oil, with less gasoil than marine diesel oil<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">MFO (Marine fuel oil)<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; same as HFO (just another &#8220;naming&#8221;)<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">HFO (Heavy fuel oil)<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Pure or nearly pure residual oil, roughly equivalent to No. 6 fuel oil<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">Marine diesel oil contains some heavy fuel oil, unlike regular diesels.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\"><strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">Standards and classification<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">CCAI and CII are two indexes which describe the ignition quality of residual fuel oil, and CCAI is especially often calculated for marine fuels. Despite this, marine fuels are still quoted on the international bunker markets with their maximum viscosity (which is set by the ISO 8217 standard &#8211; see below) due to the fact that marine engines are designed to use different viscosities of fuel. The unit of viscosity used is the centistoke (cSt) and the fuels most frequently quoted are listed below in order of cost, the least expensive first.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">IFO 380<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Intermediate fuel oil with a maximum viscosity of 380 centistokes (&lt;3.5% sulphur)<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">IFO 180<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Intermediate fuel oil with a maximum viscosity of 180 centistokes (&lt;3.5% sulphur)<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">LS 380<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Low-sulphur (&lt;1.0%) intermediate fuel oil with a maximum viscosity of 380 centistokes<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">LS 180<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Low-sulphur (&lt;1.0%) intermediate fuel oil with a maximum viscosity of 180 centistokes<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">MDO<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Marine diesel oil.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">MGO<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Marine gasoil.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-86 c1-87 c1-b c1-c c1-d c1-e c1-f c1-g\">\u00b7\u00a0<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-3a c1-3b c1-b c1-9x c1-1k c1-1e c1-9y\">LSMGO<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; Low-sulphur (&lt;0.1%) Marine Gas Oil &#8211; The fuel is to be used in EU Ports and Anchorages.

Since the purifiers use centrifugal force, the oil must have a density which is sufficiently different from water.

Over the years the standards have become stricter on environmentally important parameters such as sulfur content. The latest standard also banned the adding of used lubricating oil (ULO).<\/span><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-33 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-6bdbfcd\" data-id=\"6bdbfcd\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fuel Oil Also Known As Heavy Oil, Marine Oil, And Furnace Oil IFO380\u00a0&amp;\u00a0IFO180\u00a0are Max\u00a03.5% Sulfur\u00a0Bunkers (RME, RMF, RMG, RMH, RMK)LS380\u00a0&amp;\u00a0LS180\u00a0are Max\u00a01.0% Sulfur\u00a0BunkersULSFO\u00a0is Max\u00a00.10% Sulfur\u00a0Fuel Oil for Compliance with 2015 ECA RegulationsMGO\u00a0is, unless otherwise specified, a Max\u00a01.50% Sulfur\u00a0&#8220;Clear and Bright&#8221;
